# Clario — Odoo OCR Invoice Processing Addon

Clario OCR is an Odoo 17 addon designed to automate supplier invoice and receipt processing using **AI-powered Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**.

The module integrates **Microsoft Azure Document Intelligence** with Odoo Accounting to extract structured financial data from invoices and receipts. Extracted data is automatically used to generate **draft vendor bills**, significantly reducing manual data entry and improving accounting efficiency.

This project was originally developed as a **Senior Project (SP2)** at **Assumption University**, and has since evolved into a deployable Odoo module.

## ⚠️ Environment Requirements

Clario OCR requires an Odoo environment that supports **third-party modules**.

### Supported environments:

* Odoo.sh (official cloud hosting)
* On-premise Odoo installations

### Not supported:

* Odoo Online (SaaS)

The SaaS version does not allow custom modules and therefore cannot run Clario OCR.

---

## 🐳 Installation & Setup

The recommended method for development and testing is using **Docker**.

Only **Docker Desktop** is required — no manual Odoo installation is needed.

---

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harry-lynnoo/odoo-17-clario-ocr.git
cd odoo-17-clario-ocr

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start:

* Odoo 17
* PostgreSQL 15
* Clario OCR addon

---

### 3️⃣ Open Odoo

Open your browser:

```
http://localhost:8069
